Hello.
This will be my first attempt at build a game.
I Have 3 years web programming experience and i love games, so I thought why not make a game.
These next few posts will document my successes and failures on making a game. So join me.



Part one - Setup

So my framework of choice is Phasor.  Why Phasor you ask. Its free and the site looks awesome.
