title: About Me
---

I have over three years commercial experience working as a developer, mainly focusing on front-end technologies including JavaScript. I have started to work in the back-end environment which i highly enjoy, 
this has helped me as a developer as I now can see how all the dots are connected.

In terms of frameworks, I have worked extensively with Angular JS, Django V1 and Django REST framework.

I have experience of working in an agile environment. The code I write is heavily tested both manually and automated. I contribute to peer review. I use Project Management and version control tools as part of my daily workflow. I contribute to projects from inception all the way to deployment.
