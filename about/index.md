I have over three years commercial experience working as a developer, mainly focusing on front-end technologies including JavaScript.

In terms of frameworks, I have worked extensively with Angular, Django and Django REST framework.

I have experience of working in an agile environment. The code I write is heavily tested both manually and automated. I contribute to peer review. I use Project Management and version control tools as part of my daily workflow. I contribute to projects from inception all the way to deployment.
